# C# Library for Marketo Rest Api

[![Build Status](https://yehanghan.visualstudio.com/MarketoApi/_apis/build/status/MarketoApi-ASP.NET-CI?branchName=develop)](https://yehanghan.visualstudio.com/MarketoApi/_build/latest?definitionId=3&branchName=develop)

This is a c# library for Marketo Rest Api. I use Marketo Api in my work, but didn't find a good 
wrapper library for it. This library is built using c# language. Currently, this library is used in my own project. I hope it can be built into a general library which can be used in all kinds of c#.net projects such as asp.net mvc, blazor, WPF, Xamarin and so on. Of course compatible with both .net framwork and .net core.
